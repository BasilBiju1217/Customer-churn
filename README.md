# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (i.e., leave the company) using supervised machine learning techniques. It includes data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset: `Customer_Churn_Dataset.csv`
- Contains customer demographics, account information, service usage, and churn labels.

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify churn patterns
- Preprocess and clean the data (handle missing values, encode categoricals, scale numerics)
- Train multiple ML models to predict churn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC
- Save and deploy the best-performing model

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

---

## 📌 Key Features
- Visualizes churn trends based on contract type, tenure, payment method, etc.
- Identifies key churn drivers with correlation and feature importance
- Compares multiple machine learning models
- Model is production-ready and exportable for deployment

---

## 📈 Model Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved the highest F1-score and ROC-AUC
- Key churn indicators: month-to-month contracts, fiber optic internet, tenure < 12 months
